Personalized Yoga and health Recommendation and 
Real time posture Correction

Abstract : 
The prevalence of unsubstantiated health and yoga information on the internet tends 
to mislead people into adhering to false advice and undertaking excessively strenuous 
postures, resulting in physical harm, distress, or futile results. Existing solutions 
utilize basic NLP to recommend yoga poses based on limited keywords and lack 
intensity-based posture correction. 
Our solution overcomes the shortcomings of current health and yoga apps. It uses 
cutting-edge transformer model whose F1 sore obtained is 0.92 to understand user 
inquires for context and provides personalized health advice and yoga pose 
suggestions according to one’s job, disease, and fitness aspirations. Unlike 
conventional keyword based systems, the model produces accurate and precise 
answers by understanding meaning of complete sentence. 
In addition, the system also has a deep learning-based posture correction module, 
whose model’s test accuracy is obtained as 99.53%. It uses the MoveNet model to 
detect the main body landmarks in real-time. Users can select the posture of their 
choice and level of intensity, after which the model provides real-time audio 
instructions and feedback for correction. This guarantees that postures are executed 
according to the person’s capability, lowering the chance of damage and enhancing 
efficiency. Alternatively the system provides a complete, intuitive experience that 
promotes safe and meaningful practice of yoga.
