🧘‍♀️ Personalized Yoga & Health Recommendation and Real-Time Posture Correction
📌 Abstract
The abundance of misleading and unverified yoga and health advice online often causes individuals to follow inappropriate practices or attempt postures beyond their physical capability, resulting in injuries, discomfort, or lack of results.

Existing solutions typically rely on basic keyword-based NLP approaches, which lack contextual understanding and fail to account for posture intensity or personal health conditions.

Our solution addresses these limitations through two integrated modules:

✅ 1. Intelligent Yoga & Health Recommendation System
Uses a Transformer-based NLP model (F1 score: 0.92) to understand complete user queries, job profiles, fitness goals, and medical history.

Delivers highly personalized yoga pose suggestions and lifestyle advice based on the context—not just keywords.

Offers a health bot for direct Q&A related to sleep, diet, immunity, and general wellness.

✅ 2. AI-Based Posture Correction System
Incorporates a deep learning model with 99.53% test accuracy for real-time pose analysis.

Uses Google's MoveNet to detect and monitor key body landmarks.

Allows users to select a yoga posture and desired intensity level, then provides real-time audio feedback and correction instructions.

Ensures postures are performed safely and effectively, tailored to the user's fitness level—reducing injury risk and maximizing benefit.

This system delivers a complete, intuitive experience that promotes the safe, meaningful, and personalized practice of yoga.
